# My July computational physics practice 
This programme consist of the most challenging problem we tackled during the beginning of this year under the module Mathematical Method And Computational Physics I decided to revisits them because they are most essencial and might be helpful in future. I wanted to combined them together as a project 

~~~python

This is all the combination of computational physics I have programmed so far as from the beginning of July
Most ot these problems are base on:
