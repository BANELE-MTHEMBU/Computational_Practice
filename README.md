# Computational_Practice

# My July computational physics practice 
This programme consist of the most challenging problem we tackled during the beginning of this year under the module Mathematical Method And Computational Physics I decided to revisits them because they are most essencial and might be helpful in future. I wanted to combined them together as a project 

~~~python

This is all the combination of computational physics problems I have programmed so far as from the beginning of July till now
Most ot these problems are base on:
 - Runge Kutter Fourth Order
~~~

> Base on these lines of code there are few problems that are base on 
- Newton Raphson method
- Bisecant and,
- Simpson rule 
 > becuase these methods are simple and straightforward
